Compile and Run
Compile: `g++ -o system_monitor system_monitor.cpp`
Run: `./system_monitor`



Code Configurations
.Sleep duration: 1 second ( adjustable in `usleep(1000000)` )
.Memory units: MB ( adjustable in division by 1024 )
.CPU usage calculation: based on idle and non-idle time differences


.This code requires Linux-specific files and may not work on other operating systems.
.The CPU usage calculation assumes a single CPU core. For multi-core systems, the calculation may need adjustments.
